# Task Sync

Task Sync streams task activity from your local VS Code to Roo Code Cloud so you can monitor progress from any device — desktop, tablet, or phone. This feature is free for all users.

> Important
> - Roo Code remains completely free and open source
> - Task Sync only sends data one-way (from your IDE to the cloud) for monitoring
> - All model execution still happens locally in your VS Code
> - For remote control capabilities, see [Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control)

## What is Task Sync?

Task Sync creates a live, one-way stream of your task messages and status from your local VS Code to Roo Code Cloud so you can:
- Monitor long-running tasks from your phone while away from your desk
- See real-time updates (messages, mode changes, status)
- Check when a task completes without sitting in front of your IDE
- Review your cloud task history later

## Key Capabilities

- Realtime monitoring from any browser (desktop, tablet, phone)
- Live message stream and status indicators (running, idle, interactive)
- Cloud task history for later review
- Secure, one-way sync of task data only

## Getting Started

1. Connect your IDE (see [Login/Signup](/roo-code-cloud/login))
2. Open or start a task in your local Roo Code extension
3. Visit the dashboard at https://app.roocode.com to monitor in real time

Task Sync is available automatically after you connect your account. No extra configuration is required.

## Mobile Monitoring

Task Sync is optimized for mobile. Check in on progress between meetings, during a build, or while a model is running — without being stuck at your desk.

## Upgrading to Remote Control

If you also want to continue tasks remotely (approve actions, respond to prompts, start/stop tasks), enable [Roomote Control](/roo-code-cloud/roomote-control).  
Pro includes a free 14‑day trial, then $20/month — see [Billing & Subscriptions](/roo-code-cloud/billing-subscriptions).

## Limitations

- One-way monitoring only; no cloud commands are sent to your IDE
- Requires your IDE to be open and connected
- Internet connection required for live updates
