# Task Sharing

Share your Roo Code tasks and collaborate with others by making tasks publicly accessible through shareable links.

## Sharing from within Roo Code

### Step 1: Access the Share Option

In any active task view, locate the **link icon** <Codicon name="link" /> on the right side of the task header.

### Step 2: Choose Share Publicly

Click the link icon to open the sharing options, then select **Share Publicly**.

This option allows anyone with the link to access your task.

### Step 3: Link Created

The system will generate a public link and automatically copy it to your clipboard.

You can now share this link with team members, collaborators, or anyone who needs access to view your task and its conversation history.

## Sharing from Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Task in Dashboard

Navigate to your [Roo Code Cloud dashboard](/roo-code-cloud/dashboard) and click on the task you want to share to open the detailed task modal.

### Step 2: Open Share Modal

Within the detailed task modal, click the **Share** button to open the sharing options.

Create a public link; links expire in 30 days.

### Step 3: Create and Manage Share Links

Click **Create Share Link** to generate a new public link. Once created, you'll see the confirmation screen:

<img src="/img/task-sharing/task-sharing-5.png" alt="Share link created confirmation" width="600" />

From this screen you can:
- Copy link
- Create another link
- View previous links
- Delete links

The dashboard sharing method provides more advanced link management capabilities, including the ability to create multiple links per task and track previously generated links.

## Privacy & Security

### Controlled Sharing
- Tasks remain **private by default** - nothing is shared unless you explicitly create a share link
- You decide what to share and when
- Full control over your shared content with the ability to revoke access anytime

### Expiring Links
- All share links **automatically expire after 30 days** for enhanced security
- Expired links cannot be accessed, ensuring your shared content doesn't remain public indefinitely
- You can manually delete links at any time before expiration

### Data Control
- Delete share links whenever needed from the dashboard
- View all active share links for your tasks
- Monitor who has access to your shared content
- Maintain complete ownership of your task data
