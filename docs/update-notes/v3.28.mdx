# Roo Code 3.28 Combined Release Notes

This version introduces Task Sync & Roomote Control for monitoring and controlling tasks from your phone, plus Roo Code Cloud integration features, enhanced chat editing, conversation preservation improvements, and multiple bug fixes.

## Task Sync & Roomote Control

Introducing our new cloud connectivity features that let you **monitor and control long-running tasks from your phone** - no more waiting at your desk! ([#7799](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7799), [#7805](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7805), [#7850](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/pull/7850)):

> **Important**: Roo Code remains **completely free and open source**. Task Sync and Roomote Control are optional supplementary services that connect your local VS Code to the cloud - all processing still happens in your VS Code instance.

- **Continue Tasks Remotely**: Keep tasks going from your phone - respond to prompts, fix errors, approve actions
- **Full Chat Control**: Interact with the chatbox as though you were in your IDE
- **Start/Stop Tasks**: Launch new tasks or terminate running ones from anywhere

## QOL Improvements
