**Key Benefits:**
- **Workflow Automation**: Turn complex multi-step processes into single commands
- **Team Standardization**: Share commands across your team for consistent practices
- **Context Preservation**: Include project-specific context in every command
- **Quick Access**: Fuzzy search and autocomplete for instant command discovery

---

## Creating Custom Commands

Custom commands extend Roo Code's functionality by adding markdown files to specific directories:

- **Project-specific**: `.roo/commands/` in your workspace root
- **Global**: `~/.roo/commands/` in your home directory

The filename becomes the command name. For example:
- `review.md` → `/review`
- `test-api.md` → `/test-api`
- `deploy-check.md` → `/deploy-check`

:::info Command Name Processing
When creating commands in Settings > Slash Commands, command names are automatically processed:
- Converted to lowercase
- Spaces replaced with dashes
- Special characters removed (except dashes)
- Multiple consecutive dashes replaced with single dash
- Leading/trailing dashes removed

Example: "My Cool Command!" becomes `my-cool-command`
:::

**Basic Command Format**

Create a simple command by adding a markdown file:

```markdown
# review.md
Please review this code for:
- Performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code style violations
- Potential bugs
```

**Advanced Command with Frontmatter**

Add metadata using frontmatter for enhanced functionality:

```yaml
---
description: Comprehensive code review focusing on security and performance
argument-hint: <file or directory to review>
---

# Security-First Code Review

Please perform a thorough security review of the selected code:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Check for proper access controls
   - Verify token validation
   - Review permission checks

2. **Input Validation**
   - Identify potential injection points
   - Check for proper sanitization
   - Review data type validation

3. **Security Best Practices**
   - Look for hardcoded secrets
   - Check for secure communication
   - Review error handling for information leakage
```

**Frontmatter Fields:**
- **`description`**: Appears in the command menu to help users understand the command's purpose
- **`argument-hint`**: (Optional) Provides a hint about expected arguments when using the command. See [Argument Hints](#argument-hints) for detailed information

---

## Command Management

Create and maintain commands from Settings.

1. Click the gear icon in Roo Code and open Settings
2. Go to the Slash Commands tab
3. Click "New Command", name it, and choose location (Project or Global)
4. The command file opens with starter template content

<img src="/img/slash-commands/slash-commands-6.png" alt="Settings > Slash Commands tab for creating and managing commands" width="600" />

---

## Using Slash Commands

Type `/` in the chat to open the selection-only command menu. Use the gear icon to open Settings > Slash Commands for creating and editing commands.
<img src="/img/slash-commands/slash-commands-5.png" alt="Slash command popover with gear icon that opens Settings > Slash Commands" width="600" />

1. Selection-only: Pick from existing commands; creation and editing live in Settings
2. Autocomplete: Start typing to filter commands (e.g., `/sam` shows `sample-command-name`)
3. Description Preview: See command descriptions in the menu
4. Command Priority: Project commands override global commands with the same name

---

## Argument Hints

Argument hints provide instant help for slash commands, showing you what kind of information to provide when a command expects additional input.

When you type `/` to bring up the command menu, commands that expect arguments will display a light gray hint next to them. This hint tells you what kind of argument the command is expecting.

For example:
- `/mode <mode_slug>` - The hint `<mode_slug>` indicates you should provide a mode name like `code` or `debug`
- `/api-endpoint <endpoint-name> <http-method>` - Shows you need both an endpoint name and HTTP method

After selecting the command, it will be inserted into the chat input followed by a space. The hint is not inserted; it is only a visual guide to help you know what to type next. You must then manually type the argument after the command.

**Adding Argument Hints to Custom Commands**

You can add argument hints to your custom commands using the `argument-hint` field in the frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Generate a new REST API endpoint with best practices
argument-hint: <endpoint-name> <http-method>
---
```

This will display as `/api-endpoint <endpoint-name> <http-method>` in the command menu.

**Best Practices for Argument Hints:**
- **Be Specific**: Use descriptive placeholders like `<file-path>` instead of generic ones like `<arg>`
- **Show Multiple Arguments**: If your command needs multiple inputs, show them all: `<source> <destination>`
- **Use Consistent Format**: Always wrap placeholders in angle brackets: `<placeholder>`
- **Keep It Concise**: Hints should be brief and clear

**Common Questions:**

- **"What if I don't provide the argument?"** The command might not work as expected, or it might prompt you for more information. The hint is there to help you get it right the first time.
- **"Do all commands have hints?"** No, only commands that are designed to take arguments will have hints. Commands that work without additional input won't show hints.
- **"Can I use a command without replacing the hint?"** The hint text (like `<mode_slug>`) needs to be replaced with actual values. Leaving the hint text will likely cause the command to fail or behave unexpectedly.

- The `.md` extension is automatically added/removed as needed

**Command Content:**
- Start with a clear directive
- Use structured formats (lists, sections)
- Include specific requirements
- Reference project conventions
- Keep commands focused on a single task

**Organization:**
- Group related commands in subdirectories
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Document complex commands
- Version control your commands
- Share team commands in the project repository

## Built-in Commands

Roo Code includes powerful built-in commands that provide specialized functionality:

### The `init` Command

The `/init` command is a comprehensive AI assistant setup tool that analyzes your codebase and creates tailored configuration files. This powerful command:

**Performs Multi-Phase Analysis:**
- **Discovery Phase**: Scans your project structure and identifies key technologies
- **Project Identification**: Determines project type, frameworks, and dependencies
- **Architecture Mapping**: Analyzes code organization and patterns
- **Build/Test Detection**: Identifies build tools, test frameworks, and scripts
- **Code Style Extraction**: Captures coding conventions and patterns

**Creates AI Assistant Configuration:**
- Generates mode-specific `AGENTS.md` files in `.roo/rules-*` directories
- Creates detailed rules for different AI assistant modes (Code, Architect, Debug, etc.)
- Produces concise, high-signal documentation following the "non-obvious-only" principle
- Supports multiple AI assistant formats (Claude, Cursor, Copilot)

**Manages Project Setup:**
- Creates comprehensive todo lists for project initialization
- Identifies security and performance considerations
- Documents project-specific conventions and patterns
- Enforces quality criteria for generated documentation

**Usage:**
Simply type `/init` in the chat to analyze your codebase and set up AI assistant configuration files tailored to your project.

:::tip
The `init` command is especially useful when starting work on a new project or when you want to establish consistent AI assistant behavior across your team.

## Troubleshooting

**Commands Not Appearing:**
- **Check file location**: Ensure custom command files are in `.roo/commands/` or `~/.roo/commands/`
- **Verify file extension**: Custom commands must be `.md` files
- **Reload window**: Sometimes VS Code needs to be reloaded to detect new command files

**Command Not Found:**
When a slash command isn't found, the LLM will see an error message indicating where commands should be located. This helps guide you to create the command in the right place.

**Command Template Content:**
New commands created through the UI receive template content to help you get started. This template includes basic structure and examples that you can customize.

**Command Conflicts:**
- Project commands (`.roo/commands/`) override global commands (`~/.roo/commands/`) with the same name
- Built-in commands cannot be overridden
- When creating duplicate names through the UI, numbers are appended (e.g., `new-command-1`, `new-command-2`)

**File System Errors:**
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure you have write permissions to the `.roo/commands/` directory
- **Directory Creation**: The system will attempt to create the commands directory if it doesn't exist
- **Symbolic Links**: Command directories support symbolic links for sharing commands across projects

:::info About Mode Commands
The slash menu includes mode-switching commands (like `/code`, `/ask`) that fundamentally change the AI's operational mode - they don't just inject text but switch the entire AI context. Custom modes you create also appear as slash commands (e.g., a mode with slug `reviewer` becomes `/reviewer`). These mode commands cannot be overridden by custom workflow commands. Learn more in [Using Modes](/basic-usage/using-modes) and [Custom Modes](/features/custom-modes).
